# RedenMC mod Contributing Guidelines (codebase)

## Environment Setup

To make sure that every contributor can work well with our workflow, we do **suggest** you to use the following tools (the ones that our team uses):

- Eclipse OpenJDK (Temurin) 17 (**NOTE: You can use any other JDK/OpenJDK distribution, but version 17 is required**)
- JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA (Community or Ultimate) (latest version)

## Fork The Repository & **Create a Branch**

**Fork** the RedenMC code repository on GitHub and clone the forked repo (using IntelliJ version control or other git clients) to your local computer.

After that, create a new branch for your feature addition or bug fix.

**You MUST create a new branch for your contribution.** A clear and descriptive name for your branch is preferred (e.g. `fix/crash-when-loading` or `feat/account-system`).

## Explore Issues

Find issues from the [Issues tab](https://github.com/zly2006/reden-is-what-we-made/issues). If you find an issue you want to work on, please comment in the issue and/or attach a draft PR once available. A code maintainer will then assign the issue and/or PR to you.

If you want to fix a bug that you've found, create a bug report as usual and indicate that you are willing to fix it.

> If you've found a critical, safety or security issue, please report it to the RedenMC team directly via <info@redenmc.com>, do not create a public issue.
> We will contact you and collaborate with you after we've received your report.

If you want to add a new feature, create a feature request and indicate that you are willing to implement it. Do not start working on the feature until it is approved by a RedenMC team member.
